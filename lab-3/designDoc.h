/* Project Description
 * • Set up a 2D array with proper initial values using a vector of
 *   vectors.
 * • Given a string, implement a tokenizer to identify all the unique
 *   tokens contained whithin this string and the number of times (i.e.
 *   frequency) a given token appears in this string.
 * • Create a new datatype using struct to hold a token and its frequency;
 *   then overload a few operators for this new data type; finally, store
 *   and manage the objects of this new datatype by a vector.
 * • Implement the insertion sort algorithm to sort the list of tokens in
 *   increasing order of frequency.
 * • Implement the selection sort algorithm to sort the list of tokens in
 *   decreasing order of frequency.
